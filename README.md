## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.9.16

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Aibnb activity record from 2016 to better understand:

1. How can you improve your ratings as AirBnB host?
2. Do ratings depend on the location of the listings?
3. How much ratings depend on prices and availability?
4. Which features of each listing affects the most its ratings?
5. Are ratings realated to hosts' behaviours and experience?
6. Are ratings related to booking policies?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@karlin.giordana/how-can-you-improve-your-ratings-as-airbnb-host-17c25338103f).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
